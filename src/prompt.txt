Design a programming choice question in Rust that challenges intermediate level knowledge and understanding of the language's concepts and features. 
The exercise should test the user's proficiency in data types, control flow structures, ownership and borrowing, references, enums, traits, generics, error handling, pattern matching, lifetimes, concurrency, and the standard library.

The choice question should about the Rust language features, don't related to leetcode-style quesion. Additionally, the solution to the exercise should demonstrates best practices in Rust programming.

The output size should less than 2500,and the output should be a complete question and answer, not truncated, no other message.convert the output from English to Chinese.
